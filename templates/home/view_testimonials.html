                                As the DREAMS program's faculty coordinator, I cannot express how transformative this
                                experience has been for me. The program's emphasis on leadership, interpersonal, and
                                personal development skills has assisted me in developing skills necessary for my role
                                as a
                                teacher and mentor. 
                                Being a part of this program has also provided me with an exceptional opportunity to
                                positively impact the lives of school students. I've had the pleasure of watching
                                students
                                discover their strengths and develop essential skills that will help them succeed in all
                                aspects
                                of life through the DREAMS program. 
                                It allowed me to positively impact lives and community, while also expanding my
                                collaboration network, research and publication opportunities.
                                My goal for the DREAMS program is to broaden its reach and impact. The program has the
                                potential to benefit even more students and communities worldwide, and I am excited to
                                be a
                                part of making that vision a reality.
                                This program has taught me much about myself, my community, and the power of mentoring
                                and leadership. Although there have been difficulties along the way, they have only
                                reinforced my belief in the importance of this program and its ability to effect
                                positive change
                                in the world.

                                GYLN is one of the best things that happened to me this year. I started as a regular
                                mentor
                                in a
                                small chapter of Dreams, from there I became the coordinator of Dreams media and finally
                                to
                                GYLN. In
                                GYLN, we have people coming from different walks of life, countries, cultures,
                                languages,
                                and
                                qualifications. At GYLN I have an opportunity to show my talents, learn about new
                                experiences and
                                cultures. At times the team identifies my problems and tries to give me a better
                                solution. I
                                am
                                really happy and proud to be a member of GYLN. The only suggestion I have is to bring up
                                more
                                activities and participants in the coming future.

                                During my school days, I was often labeled as a weak student and struggled to express
                                myself. This caused me to run away from challenges and opportunities that I felt were
                                beyond my capabilities. However, everything changed when I joined the DREAMS program.The
                                DREAMS program has been a game-changer for me, helping me to grow in ways I never
                                thought possible. It has given me hope and enabled me to overcome my fears, allowing me
                                to dream bigger and achieve more in my life.One of the most valuable aspects of the
                                program has been the ample opportunities it provides. As a DREAMS participant, I have
                                been a mentor, leader, coordinator, and trainer, all of which have been invaluable
                                experiences in my personal and professional development.
                                Through these roles, I have learned important skills such as communication,
                                collaboration, and problem-solving, which have helped me succeed in the program and my
                                career and personal life. Overall, the DREAMS program has been a transformative
                                experience for me. It has helped me to develop into a more confident and capable
                                individual, and given me the tools to pursue my dreams and achieve my goals. I am
                                grateful for the opportunity to be a part of such an incredible program, and I would
                                highly recommend it to anyone looking to grow and achieve their full potential.

                                When I first came to the DREAMS, I thought it was just another summer camp. I didn’t
                                quite understand the full concept of it, and most definitely I didn't realize the impact
                                it would soon have not only on these kids but also on myself. Day one of my first summer
                                program felt a little new to everyone, both to the students and to the mentors. Everyone
                                was just getting to know one another, and even for me personally as an introvert, it was
                                a little difficult at first to go out there and make small talk, but then I saw how some
                                students were doing it with such ease. So they inspired me the very first day, before we
                                even began lessons. Around the third day, it seemed as if they had been friends for
                                quite a while. The formation of relationships between the students was such a beautiful
                                thing to see. This program not only teaches students life values, but it also
                                demonstrates how they can put these values into practice in their everyday lives.
                                Normally we have all groups with a few students and two mentors, and we get to teach and
                                pour into them how we learned these values over these years and the ways we succeeded in
                                doing them, or how we felt and learned from it. Different speakers from the same town
                                will come and talk about a particular value that day, and you can really see how the
                                students relate to and listen to that person, especially because they mostly come from
                                our own town. The very best part of teaching students these values is seeing them come
                                back and tell you how they've used them, and even better, the parents will come back and
                                talk about the transformation they’ve seen in their child. Perhaps my personal favorite
                                part of this program is that we choose students who are already filled to some extent
                                with humility; they are not necessarily the leaders or the most popular of their class,
                                but they are students ready to listen and put into practice what they have learned, and
                                I think thats what makes a good leader, i love that we give this type of student this
                                opportunity. These are the kinds of future leaders we need. We teach them to always have
                                faith in God, and through him they can do anything. So these students are not only
                                becoming transformed into leaders, but they are transforming everyone around them as
                                well, such as their mentors.

                                <b>“We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give." - Winston
                                    Churchill</b>
                                If I must answer a question, why I joined Dreams, this quote explains my journey with
                                Dreams perfectly. As we know, Dreams is an intergenerational program and inspiration
                                comes in all shapes and sizes. If I mentor students younger than me, I am also gaining
                                knowledge from these mentors.
                                Throughout our lives, we are always taught to listen to our elders, because they have a
                                wealth of knowledge and experience to share - which is true. But what often goes
                                underappreciated is what we can learn from the younger generations around us as we get
                                older. It could be how to appreciate new technologies, be more open minded and
                                accepting, appreciating little moments or following your dreams, no matter what.
                                Also, to reach any significant goal in life we need to overcome challenges along the
                                way. But all of us working with Dreams consider ourselves " A FAMILY" and together we
                                encounter each obstacle and press ourselves forward making DREAMS our "HAPPY PLACE"!!!
                                I have been a part of Dreams for 3 years and all I want to say to anyone who is ready to
                                volunteer as a Community Leader, is that it's the most wholesome experience as we are
                                giving our time in this program as TIME IS CONSIDERED THE BIGGEST GIFT you can gift
                                anyone and what can be better than the community, we live in. So come let's join hands
                                in this program and make a difference in the world we live in.

                                I was introduced to DREAMS by Mr. James Anithottam, the  then head of its affairs in Changanacherry in 2018. As a retired teacher, the idea of DREAMS fascinated me as I felt it was a solution  to the imbalance between the slow learners and fast movers. Completion of school syllabus is time bound and teachers normally move on with the fast, intelligent students.  This prevented the slow learners from gaining enough in their academic journey. 

                                Experiencing further,  I realized that the scope of DREAMS is far reaching. It benefited not only the slow learners but all its stakeholders. The key is direct involvement and practice.  You are into listening, reading, writing, speaking, dancing, acting, drawing, playing, emulating and whatever....., your best is brought out!.
                                
                                The DREAMS curriculum is unmatched.  It aims at developing personal, social and leadership qualities in a short, 28 day program.  It literally makes one grow gracefully to maturity, empowering self, acquiring values, mastering skills, making socially responsible, committed and trustworthy. I am happy and feel accomplished as I see our efforts make a huge difference in society. Parents very often express their gratitude for the positive changes in their children. Mentors, the middle rung DREAMS family, through their involvement grow strong, confident and well equipped to face their future. 
                                
                                For me, it is also a platform to make friends and to give back to the Community from the bounty of blessings I received from it.

                                First and foremost, I was impressed by the passion and vision with which DREAMS is now being implemented worldwide. In my opinion, the topics of empowerment, strengthening one's own resilience and dealing with one's own goals, desires and feelings are given far too little attention in our society. It's more about performance and less about the question of what talents/passions exist and how they can be lived out. DREAMS deals with all of this outside of the school and family context, so that the students can learn more freely, at their own pace, without pressure. One student said in the last workshop that DREAMS means joy to her. At that point it was clear to me that we, especially the students, had done everything right.
                                The intensive and continuous support by the students, the trust in the group led to the fact that even difficult (biographical) topics could be discussed and endured together. The massive social and world-political conflicts and crises put a great strain on young people, but they are often alone with their worries and fears. The pressure to 'parry' and to fulfill the roles of student or son/daughter as inconspicuous as possible makes it difficult to address one's own needs with caregivers and teachers. DREAMS has helped students emerge empowered.
                                For the future of DREAMS, I would like to see us bring the differences from the various countries and cultures closer together and see how we can profit from these different experiences.

                                The Let Us Dream Conference has been one of the most inspiring experiences for the
                                students I teach at Grambling State University (GSU) and for me since 2017. Dr. Glenda
                                Island, Chair of the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences at GSU invited me to
                                join her in 2018 for the conference at La Tech University in Ruston, LA as a part of the
                                GSU our partnership with Christ University and Father Lijo, Founder of the conference.
                                Since 2017 I have engaged students in the LUD conferences domestically and abroad into
                                my classes as an example of teaching servant and transformational leadership, social
                                responsibility and globalization. My most memorable single moment was in 202( during the
                                Pandemic) when the Student Panel was highlighted with student's comments and reflections
                                on giving back to their communities and others in need. This panel awakened my inner
                                core of what teaching and learning is all about and I continue to keep this spark today
                                and into the future with this conference. Each time we begin to plan for the LUD
                                Conferences in Louisiana each year, a natural disaster or worldwide or local crisis has
                                occurred, but this has not put a damper on our ability to gather together, share
                                insightful thoughts, research and practices and work to help us help others in the name
                                of service to mankind. For the many persons who are Unsung Heroes, I salute Father Lijo
                                and The Let Us Dream Conference is a master in featuring everyday great ones to give in
                                the areas of health, education and social justice for all. I remain a LUD advocate and
                                look forward to 2023 in India.

                                Zurich to Kerala and Bangalore....breaking barriers and building bridges across the
                                boundaries defined by geography with only one philosophy...to make this world a better
                                place! LUD Triennial Conference 2020 became the beacon of hope for all of us involved,
                                so much so that we continued with the same spirit in organising the Annual Conference in
                                2021 and Local Conference in 2022 with the same zeal and enthusiasm. The success of
                                these 3 years is not defined by the 40000+ registrations or views online but by the
                                leaders nurtured through volunteerism and lives touched that make ordinary days seem
                                extraordinarily blessed!.

                                In my role, I have worked with and helped coordinate the Let Us Dream Conference at
                                Binghamton University since 2019 and have been amazed by the impact which this
                                organization has had across the globe. The Let Us Dream Conferences has allowed
                                practitioners, learners and community members come together, hone their skills in a
                                variety of disciplines, and invigorate one another to bring out and strengthen
                                sentiments of community, empathy and care which is already ingrained in the community
                                itself. I love recruiting students, faculty members and staff at Binghamton University
                                to get involved with the Let Us Dream Conferences as it provides an opportunity for
                                international, interdisciplinary collaboration where you meet others who are passionate,
                                innovative and driven to educate others about best-practices that will better the lives
                                of others, while learning how to translate those skills in your own work. Let Us Dream
                                has endless opportunities for involvement and working with Dean Laura Bronstein, Michael
                                Kaufmann, Tracy Lyman and Jeff Smith has been such an amazing experience to see the
                                wonderful work of those in the Binghamton community get recognized on a national- and
                                global-level. It’s been such an honor to work with such accomplished, hardworking
                                individuals who exemplify how to be a positive agent of change and empower others to do
                                the same. I look forward to the continued partnership and collaboration between
                                Binghamton University and Let Us Dream and how this work will positively change the
                                local community in the years to come.

                                60 years ago, on 18 August 1963, Martin Luther King gave his "I have a dream" speech at
                                the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. It is one of the most famous speeches of the 20th
                                century. The dream was to fight racial discrimination and to treat all citizens equal
                                before the law.
                                The dream of a better society is more relevant than ever. In the 21st century, too,
                                there is hope of living in a society without discrimination and gender inequality. Hope,
                                that companies take on social responsibility, produce sustainably and protect the
                                environment.
                                Unique about all these dreams is, that they will only be fulfilled, if we stand up for
                                our convictions, act on them ourselves and convince others of our dreams.
                                At the "Let us Dream"-conferences we dream together. The cooperation supported by
                                visionary and committed people from all over the world is not only an important source
                                of joy and inspiration. It is also a strong motivator for specific measures for
                                implementation and helps enduring all the obstacles and setbacks along the way.


                                Through the international exchange I was lucky to experience creativity and the power of
                                imagination emerge across borders, so new ideas and innovations could be developed. The
                                "Let us Dream"-conferences are supported by a community and live from the commitment and
                                contributions of the volunteers. This is a gift and it would be great, if, at the end of
                                the 21st century, the project was as well known as the speech mentioned in the
                                beginning.

                                My experience with the Dreams Professional Club has been tremendous. I have been
                                associated with it right from the beginning. No matter what, I make it a point to attend
                                all meetings. I must have missed it only a handful of times. I have found the meetings
                                to be very useful. Since we are all people from different backgrounds, there is so much
                                diversity and a wide array of perceptions here. The way each person approaches a
                                challenge or an issue is vastly different, because each person's background, thought
                                process, style of approach is so different and it gives everyone great learning
                                opportunities. There is a lot of safety in this space and one can speak one's mind
                                without worrying whether one is judged or not. When everyone is sharing their life
                                experiences and not some arbitrary theory, the conversations get very interesting
                                because they come from a space of great authenticity and vulnerability.

                                been an enriching experience that has broadened my horizons and expanded my professional
                                network and net-worth!

                                My journey with DREAMS has paved the way for my Mastery, starting as a volunteer,
                                progressing to a mentor, then a chapter coordinator, then an overall program
                                coordinator, and now a part of the Global Youth Leadership Network (GYLN) as a national
                                representative. The Success and fulfillment I have achieved in both personal and
                                professional aspects of my life are a testament to my experiences in this organization.
                                DREAMS has put me in touch with my skills and passion suitable for a career in
                                psychology. Something that I would take away and would like to pass down to the next
                                generations of the organization, in, Rev. Father Lijo’s words “We all have made
                                sacrifices in our lives, and the time we invest in the organization is one such
                                sacrifice that we choose to make. It is important to make them count.” We thrive on
                                commitment and volunteerism

                                I am excited to be a part of the DREAM Conversation Club. This experience allows a
                                global group of professionals to discuss various cultural, societal, and political
                                topics in a spirit of collaboration and respect for each other’s differences. “I
                                understand’ these are two of the most powerful words you can say, personally and
                                professionally. Whether we believe in the power of our daily rituals or hold a
                                world-shifting viewpoint, acknowledging and respecting the perspectives of others is the
                                tool that fuels the depth, value, and meaning of our contribution to and relationships
                                with them. We all have varying opinions and ideas, making monthly conversations more
                                interesting.
                                The most rewarding takeaway from being a member of the DREAM Conversation Club is that
                                when we can use our lens as a point of relatability to support another in their
                                viewpoint or to provide a unique perspective that may foster an expanded view for them.

                                on people as the songs the band performs and the performances are very life-centric.
                                Each performance for me was reliving the success through struggles in life, or
                                cherishing the past memories.
                                One of the most memorable moments of my time with the band was my first day in the band.
                                To have got selected as a keyboardist for the band was a huge surprise in my life and a
                                turning point to an in depth exploration in the field of music. As soon as I entered the
                                jam room I could see a few musicians I really looked up to and the space made me feel
                                very comfortable and I felt belonged. I found a bunch of friends who later in life
                                turned out to be a strong support system and family away from home.
                                The vision and mission of the band is what attracted me. Coming from a family involved
                                in ministry I grew up understanding the importance of bringing a change in the society
                                using my passion for music. The Band has absolutely put me in the most uncomfortable
                                situations to mold me to become a good leader and teacher. The functioning in the band
                                really made me capable of multiple responsibilities which includes coordination and
                                other soft skills very essential for working under any institution.

                                Being part of the dreams band for me was a journey of self-discovery and holistic
                                growth. It didn't only help me improve my musical abilities, but it also helped me to
                                enhance my other skills like teamwork, leadership, decision-making, and social skills.
                                Being in the same room with hardworking and dedicated individuals had a positive impact
                                on me, and i was fortunate to have been able to learn so much from all the band members
                                who were part of dreams band over the years. The most wonderful thing about the dreams
                                band is that they never look for the best musicians. They instead look for the most
                                dedicated and focused ones who are looking to grow holistically and are passionate about
                                the goal of the Let us dream project. This is what sets it apart from any other band out
                                there.

                                DREAMS is a wonderful Afterschool intervention programme I have ever seen as it
                                works on the idea of a sustainable and replicable model. It is nice to see young
                                college students and community leaders coming forward for a larger social cause. I
                                along with young researchers at DREAMS engaged ourselves with a couple of
                                community-based research at DREAMS and I am sure findings would help the society.
                                DREAMS is really a life-giving platform to all those who have otherwise never dared
                                to emerge as a successful and well-groomed individual. I wish the spirit and
                                dedication of youth energy at DREAMS must be preserved, developed, and nurtured. I
                                am sure the research series will ensure greater credibility and scientific culture
                                across all the wings of DREAM.
