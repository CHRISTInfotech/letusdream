                    As the DREAMS program's faculty coordinator, I cannot express how transformative this
                    experience has been for me. The program's emphasis on leadership, interpersonal, and
                    personal development skills has assisted me in developing skills necessary for my role as a
                    teacher and mentor. <br>
                    Being a part of this program has also provided me with an exceptional opportunity to
                    positively impact the lives of school students. I've had the pleasure of watching students
                    discover their strengths and develop essential skills that will help them succeed in all aspects
                    of life through the DREAMS program.  <br>
                    It allowed me to positively impact lives and community, while also expanding my
                    collaboration network, research and publication opportunities.  <br>
                    My goal for the DREAMS program is to broaden its reach and impact. The program has the
                    potential to benefit even more students and communities worldwide, and I am excited to be a
                    part of making that vision a reality.  <br>
                    This program has taught me much about myself, my community, and the power of mentoring
                    and leadership. Although there have been difficulties along the way, they have only
                    reinforced my belief in the importance of this program and its ability to effect positive change
                    in the world.

                    GYLN is one of the best things that happened to me this year. I started as a regular mentor in a
                    small chapter of Dreams, from there I became the coordinator of Dreams media and finally to GYLN. In
                    GYLN, we have people coming from different walks of life, countries, cultures, languages, and
                    qualifications. At GYLN I have an opportunity to show my talents, learn about new experiences and
                    cultures. At times the team identifies my problems and tries to give me a better solution. I am
                    really happy and proud to be a member of GYLN. The only suggestion I have is to bring up more
                    activities and participants in the coming future.

                    I love the platform and I feel the platform provides a lot of opportunities to talk and grow. I’m
                    comfortable speaking during each meeting and your team made us comfortable to interact with the
                    participants. I truly enjoy the experience. I think each meeting is always fun because we discuss

                    As a whole, I think the GLYN platform is amazing. It gets young leaders to interact with one another
                    on an international level. Can never have too much of that. It’s very great to have engaging
                    discussions with each one of them.
