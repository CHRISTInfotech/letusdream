                    <p class="mb-0">The Young Community Leadership Program (YCLP) is to prepare young aspiring leaders
                        with the
                        skills and experience needed to generate transformative social change. The interdisciplinary
                        program emphasizes highly applied coursework, relationship building, and hands-on practical
                        experiences which are essential components for developing strong leadership, mentoring and
                        coaching skills. The program involves enhancing the community leadership and mentoring skills
                        among students of undergraduate programs through planning and organizing peer mentoring programs
                        in identified schools.
                        <br>
                        The students will be trained to be sensitive to the psycho-social and leadership needs of the
                        teenage students in schools and help them develop those skills through diverse interventions
                        such as training, mentoring, games, music, theater, activities, etc. for three years with a set
                        curriculum. In addition, students will be introduced a community intervention model (DREAMS) and
                        they will be trained how to initiate and implement an action plan to make some substantial and
                        sustainable positive difference in the life of those lower performing teenagers.
