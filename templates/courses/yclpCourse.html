                            The Young Community Leadership Program (YCLP) is to prepare young aspiring leaders with the skills and experience needed to generate transformative social change. The interdisciplinary program emphasizes highly applied coursework, relationship building, and hands-on practical experiences which are essential components for developing strong leadership, mentoring and coaching skills. The program involves enhancing the community leadership and mentoring skills among students of undergraduate programs through planning and organizing peer mentoring programs in identified schools.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The students will be trained to be sensitive to the psycho-social and leadership needs of the teenage students in schools and help them develop those skills through diverse interventions such as training, mentoring, games, music, theater, activities, etc. for three years with a set curriculum. In addition, students will be introduced a community intervention model (DREAMS) and they will be trained how to initiate and implement an action plan to make some substantial and sustainable positive difference in the life of those lower performing teenagers.
