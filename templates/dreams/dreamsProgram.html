                        The DREAMS ( Desire, Readiness, Empowerment, Action and Mastery for Success) is a structured
                        five stage approach designed to foster psycho-social and leadership development of an
                        individual. Based on scientific theories , the DREAMS model begin with Desire and Readiness
                        stage which incorporates goal setting and motivational theories while the Empowerment , Action
                        and Mastery stages are grounded in self determination theory (Thomas , L. 2024, Pilot study,
                        DREAMS Program - Journal of School Administration, Research and Development).
                        Developed by Dr. Fr. Lijo Thomas, this evidence-based, three-year after-school program pairs
                        underperforming middle school students with mentors from college and senior adults in the local
                        community. Focused on mentoring, modeling, and motivating, these mentors help guide, inspire,
                        and empower young participants, supporting their growth and resilience.

                    Why Dreams

                <div class="lh-lg">
                    The DREAMS program is a transformative three- year intervention designed to foster authentic
                    leadership, emotional intelligence, civic responsibility, and social consciousness. By harnessing
                    the potential of university students, DREAMS program strategically impacts three age groups:
                    adolescents, young adults, and senior adults.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    DREAMS key goal is to reconnect local communities with educational institutions while enhancing
                    youth leadership. Through intergenerational and intercultural mentoring, senior adults such as
                    retirees and community volunteers share their wisdom, skills and values with young participants
                    while young adults contribute their knowledge and hard skills. This exchange bridges generational
                    gaps, allowing for the transfer of essential skills, cultural values and experiences among all the
                    participants. Thus, DREAMS strengthen community ties and build a shared sense of purpose.

                        The DREAMS acronym represents the cyclical model that guides participants through their journey
                        of self-development:
                        <br/>
                        1. <span class="fw-bold">D</span>esire is the first step, where external, extrinsic motivations
                        ignite an intense fascination or attraction toward goals in life.
                        <br/>
                        2. <span class="fw-bold">R</span>eadiness follows, involving internalizing these goals and
                        transforming extrinsic motivations into intrinsic ones.
                        <br/>
                        3. <span class="fw-bold">E</span>mpowerment equips participants with the psycho-social and
                        leadership skills necessary for holistic growth.
                        <br/>
                        4. <span class="fw-bold">A</span>ction is the stage where participants take real steps towards
                        their goals, building momentum through perseverance and effort.
                        <br/>
                        5. <span class="fw-bold">M</span>astery or excellence is the final stage, where sustained effort
                        leads to success, and the cycle begins again as new, higher goals are set.

                        The three-year curriculum focuses on personal, interpersonal, and leadership development for
                        underperforming middle school students, supported by college students and senior adults. It
                        begins with identifying 40-45 middle school students in need, 30 college mentors, and 8-10
                        senior volunteers, organized into five groups using the D-R-E-A-M model (Development,
                        Resilience, Empowerment, Achievement, Mentorship). Each group features a 1:2 mentoring ratio,
                        ensuring personalized attention. The program includes 8 days of physical intervention each
                        quarter—5 days of summer camp followed by 3 follow-up sessions—complemented by monthly virtual
                        subgroup meetings to work on community service capstone projects. This structure aims to enhance
                        students' personal growth and leadership skills while fostering mentorship in college students,
                        with a continuous feedback loop to evaluate progress and community impact.
