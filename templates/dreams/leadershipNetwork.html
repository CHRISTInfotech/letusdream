                        GYLN is a platform for emerging and prospective youth leaders (from various DREAMS’
                        Chapters) to
                        learn and develop their leadership skills while networking with equally aspiring individuals
                        around the globe.
                        The youth of today are the leaders tomorrow. Our young generation needs to enhance their

                        through which they can contribute to an organization’s growth and upliftment of society.
                        <br>
                        In the contemporary world, many young people find it hard in building meaningful
                        relationships with others,
                        with this initiative the youth will get an opportunity for self-growth and creating
                        meaningful relationships
                        with others in the network. By promoting the three pillars of GLYN: ​Leadership, Personal
                        Empowerment,
                        and Social Empowerment GYLN create a safe and holistic space for youth to share their
                        experiences and knowledge.

                    GYLN is one of the best things that happened to me this year. I started as a regular mentor in a small chapter of Dreams, from there I became the coordinator of Dreams media and finally to GYLN.  In GYLN, we have people coming from different walks of life, countries,  cultures, languages, and qualifications. At GYLN I have an opportunity to show my talents, learn about new experiences and cultures.  At times the team identifies my problems and tries to give me a better solution. I am really happy and proud to be a member of GYLN. The only suggestion I have is to bring up more activities and participants in the coming future.

                            As a whole, I think the GLYN platform is amazing. It gets young leaders to interact with one another on an international level. Can never have too much of that. It’s very great to have engaging discussions with each one of them.
