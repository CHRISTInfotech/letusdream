         <div class="pg">
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of “Be the Change you wish to see in the World” has been our motto and a guiding principle since our inception. The LET US DREAM team has always been inspired by the quote of the Saint of the Gutters, Mother Teresa. She said, “What we are doing is just a drop in the ocean. But if that drop was not in the ocean, I think the ocean would be less because of that missing drop.”</p>
            <p>Inspired thus, LET US DREAM extends an invitation to every individual to join this global community in order to raise and uplift our societies to progressive and better living standards so that we and the generations to come may reap the benefits of the seeds we sow today.</p>
            <p>Each of us is called to act as a catalyst to positively impact another person in our life’s time. Each of us has the power to foster positive change, which will have a spiralling impact to make the world a better place.</p>

        <h3>EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES</h3>
        <p>The LET US DREAM organizational culture is rooted in the universal human values after the vision of St. Kuriakose Elias Chavara, that is, the integral formation of a person and commitment to the society. We as humans have so much to offer to the society. Success of each individual, strengthens and acts a s foundation for the society to grow in.  We believe humanity to be one global family, tied together, where our excellence and holistic success as an individual or as a society is interdependent on each other. Growing in the holistic view of life, we would like to DREAM together and grow together</p>
