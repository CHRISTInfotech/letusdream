                        LET US DREAM is a locally rooted and globally established Not-for-Profit Organization. It was
                        conceived with the idea to create holistically developed communities world over. It has strived
                        for this since its inception. We, at LET US DREAM, firmly vouch in the idea of a global family,
                        where each individual and each society works interdependently to create a sustainable world. The
                        program is composed of likeminded people from all ethnic groups around the world to support,
                        guide, and lead this vision of holistic development in the growth of individuals and the
                        society.

                Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of “Be the Change you wish to see in the World” has been our motto and a
                guiding principle since our inception. The LET US DREAM team has always been inspired by the quote of
                the Saint of the Gutters, Mother Teresa. She said, “What we are doing is just a drop in the ocean. But
                if that drop was not in the ocean, I think the ocean would be less because of that missing drop.”
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify lh-lg">
                Inspired thus, LET US DREAM extends an invitation to every individual to join this global community in
                order to raise and uplift our societies to progressive and better living standards so that we and the
                generations to come may reap the benefits of the seeds we sow today. Each of us is called to act as a
                catalyst to positively impact another person in our life’s time. Each of us has the power to foster
                positive change, which will have a spiralling impact to make the world a better place.

                        The LET US DREAM organizational culture is rooted in the universal human values after the vision
                        of St. Kuriakose Elias Chavara, that is, the integral formation of a person and commitment to
                        the society. We as humans have so much to offer to the society. Success of each individual,
                        strengthens and acts a s foundation for the society to grow in. We believe humanity to be one
                        global family, tied together, where our excellence and holistic success as an individual or as a
                        society is interdependent on each other. Growing in the holistic view of life, we would like to
                        DREAM together and grow together

                        Finding his own confidence through music, Father Reverend Lijo Thomas Pathickal, CMI, wanted to
                        assist people to help children who are under confident, shy and struggle to showcase their
                        capabilities. The drive to share his insights with others like him and helping them realize
                        their full potential led him to forming the DREAM Program. The journey for developing and
                        implementing the programme has been through turbulent and testing times but the sheer will power
                        and the conviction of Rev Fr Lijo Thomas to help the others has helped the project stay afloat
                        for many years now.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify lh-lg">
                        The Project gradually expanded but the turning point came in 2010, while he was pursuing his
                        Ph.D. in Educational Leadership, at the University of Louisiana, Monroe. His mentor at the time,
                        Dr Pauline Leonard, a professor at Louisiana Tech University, suggested that DREAM had the
                        potential of being developed into a working, scientific model and that was the moment the
                        project steered towards the direction it is flowing in today. It has become a 3-year
                        curriculum-based community mentoring project, for schools and colleges. Each year focuses on the
                        development of skills and leadership, both at the personal and at the communal levels. The
                        program is further designed to encourage children, especially those with low self-confidence, to
                        rise up to their maximum potential, while also motivating others to do the same around them.
                        Through a 3-stage developmental model, <strong>DREAM</strong> helps individuals to work through
                        <strong>D</strong>esire, <strong>R</strong>eadiness, <strong>E</strong>mpowerment, and
                        <strong>A</strong>ction, to attain <strong>M</strong>astery for success.
