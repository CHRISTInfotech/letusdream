                            Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of “Be the Change you wish to see in the
                            World” has been our motto and a guiding principle since our inception. The LET US DREAM team
                            has always been inspired by the quote of
                            the Saint of the Gutters, Mother Teresa. She said, “What we are doing is just a drop in the
                            ocean. But if
                            that drop was not in the ocean, I think the ocean would be less because of that missing
                            drop.”

                            Inspired thus, LET US DREAM extends an invitation to every individual
                            to join this global community in order to raise and uplift our societies to progressive and
                            better living standards so that we and the
                            generations to come may reap the benefits of the seeds we sow today. Each of us is called to
                            act as a catalyst to positively impact another
                            person in our life’s time. Each of us has the power to foster positive change, which will
                            have a spiralling impact to make the world a
                            better place.

                    The LET US DREAM organizational culture is rooted in
                    the universal human
                    values after the vision of St. Kuriakose Elias Chavara, that is, the integral
                    formation of a person and commitment to the society.
                    We as humans have so much to offer to the society. Success of each individual,
                    strengthens and acts a s
                    foundation for the society to grow in. We believe humanity to be one global
                    family, tied together, where our
                    excellence and holistic success as an individual or as a society is
                    interdependent on each other. Growing in
                    the holistic view of life, we would like to DREAM together and grow together

                <p class="text-justify lh-lg">Finding his own confidence through music,
                    Father Reverend Lijo
                    Thomas Pathickal, CMI, wanted to assist people to help children who are
                    under confident, shy and struggle to
                    showcase their capabilities. The drive to share his insights with others
                    like him and helping them realize their
                    full potential led him to forming the DREAM Program. The journey for
                    developing and implementing the
                    programme has been through turbulent and testing times but the sheer will
                    power and the conviction of Rev Fr
                    Lijo Thomas to help the others has helped the project stay afloat for many
                    years now.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify lh-lg">The Project gradually expanded but the
                    turning point came in 2010, while he was
                    pursuing his Ph.D. in Educational Leadership, at the University of
                    Louisiana, Monroe. His mentor at the time, Dr
                    Pauline Leonard, a professor at Louisiana Tech University, suggested that
                    DREAM had the potential of being
                    developed into a working, scientific model and that was the moment the
                    project steered towards the direction it is
                    flowing in today. It has become a 3-year curriculum-based community
                    mentoring project, for schools and colleges.
                    Each year focuses on the development of skills and leadership, both at the
                    personal and at the communal levels. The
                    program is further designed to encourage children, especially those with low
                    self-confidence, to rise up to their
                    maximum potential, while also motivating others to do the same around them.
                    Through a 3-stage developmental
                    model, <strong>DREAM</strong> helps individuals to work through
                    <strong>D</strong>esire, <strong>R</strong>eadiness,
                    <strong>E</strong>mpowerment, and <strong>A</strong>ction, to attain
                    <strong>M</strong>astery for success.
