            <p style="text-align:justify"> LET US DREAM is a locally rooted and globally established Not-for-Profit
                Organization. It was conceived with the idea to create holistically developed communities world over. It
                has
                strived for this since its inception.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> We, at LET US DREAM, firmly vouch in the idea of a global family, where each
                individual and each society works interdependently to create a sustainable world. The program is
                composed of
                likeminded people from all ethnic groups around the world to support, guide, and lead this vision of
                holistic development in the growth of individuals and the society.</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"> LET US DREAM operates using an impactful and effective community-based
                working
                model that join people together while also bridging community organizations together. LET US DREAM aids,
                nurtures, and hones the untapped potentials of individuals in the psycho-social leadership aspects of
                life.
                LET US DREAM, through rigorous research and continuous evaluation, strives to accomplish this vision
                through
                its four unique projects:</p>
            <a href="{% url 'dreams' 'program' %}" style="text-decoration: none;">DREAMS Program</a> , &nbsp;
            <a href="{% url 'dreams' 'band' %}" style="text-decoration: none;">DREAMS Band</a> , &nbsp;
            <a href="{% url 'dreams' 'proclub' %}" style="text-decoration: none;">DREAMS Pro Club</a> , &nbsp;
            <a href="{% url 'about-conference' %}" style="text-decoration: none;">Let Us Dream Conferences</a>
            <p></p>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of “Be the Change you wish to see in the World” has been our motto and a
                guiding
                principle since our inception. The LET US DREAM team has always been inspired by the quote of the Saint
                of
                the Gutters, Mother Teresa. She said, “What we are doing is just a drop in the ocean. But if that drop
                was
                not in the ocean, I think the ocean would be less because of that missing drop.”</p>
            <p>Inspired thus, LET US DREAM extends an invitation to every individual to join this global community in
                order
                to raise and uplift our societies to progressive and better living standards so that we and the
                generations
                to come may reap the benefits of the seeds we sow today.</p>
            <p>Each of us is called to act as a catalyst to positively impact another person in our life’s time. Each of
                us
                has the power to foster positive change, which will have a spiralling impact to make the world a better
                place.</p>

        <h3>EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES</h3>
        <p>The LET US DREAM organizational culture is rooted in the universal human values after the vision of St.
            Kuriakose Elias Chavara, that is, the integral formation of a person and commitment to the society. We as
            humans have so much to offer to the society. Success of each individual, strengthens and acts a s foundation
            for the society to grow in. We believe humanity to be one global family, tied together, where our excellence
            and holistic success as an individual or as a society is interdependent on each other. Growing in the
            holistic view of life, we would like to DREAM together and grow together</p>

                <p>Finding his own confidence through music, Father Reverend Lijo Thomas Pathickal, CMI, wanted to
                    assist people to help children who are under confident, shy and struggle to showcase their
                    capabilities. The drive to share his insights with others like him and helping them realise their
                    full potential led him to forming the DREAM Program. The journey for developing and implementing the
                    programme has been through turbulent and testing times but the sheer will power and the conviction
                    of Rev Fr Lijo Thomas to help the others has helped the project stay afloat for many years now. </p>
                <p>The Project gradually expanded but the turning point came in 2010, while he was pursuing his Ph.D. in
                    Educational Leadership, at the University of Louisiana, Monroe. His mentor at the time, Dr Pauline
                    Leonard, a professor at Louisiana Tech University, suggested that DREAM had the potential of being
                    developed into a working, scientific model and that was the moment the project steered towards the
                    direction it is flowing in today. It has become a 3-year curriculum-based community mentoring
                    project, for schools and colleges. Each year focuses on the development of skills and leadership,
                    both at the personal and at the communal levels. The program is further designed to encourage
                    children, especially those with low self-confidence, to rise up to their maximum potential, while
                    also motivating others to do the same around them. Through a 3-stage developmental model, <strong>DREAM</strong>
                    helps individuals to work through <strong>D</strong>esire, <strong>R</strong>eadiness,
                    <strong>E</strong>mpowerment, and <strong>A</strong>ction, to attain <strong>M</strong>astery for
                    success.</p>
                <p>A motivation and an inspiration, Father Reverend Lijo Thomas Pathickal has purposed his life to
                    helping others grow. </p>
