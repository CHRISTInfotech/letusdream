                <p class="text-justify"> LET US DREAM is a locally rooted and globally established Not-for-Profit
                    Organization. It was conceived with the idea to create holistically developed communities world
                    over. It has strived for this since its inception. We, at LET US DREAM, firmly vouch in the idea of a global family,
                    where each individual and each society works interdependently to create a sustainable world. The program is
                    composed of likeminded people from all ethnic groups around the world to support, guide, and
                    lead this vision of holistic development in the growth of individuals and the society.</p>
                <p class="text-justify"> LET US DREAM operates using an impactful and effective community-based
                    working model that join people together while also bridging community organizations together. LET US
                    DREAM aids, nurtures, and hones the untapped potentials of individuals in the psycho-social leadership
                    aspects of life.
                    LET US DREAM, through rigorous research and continuous evaluation, strives to accomplish this
                    vision through its four unique projects:</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of “Be the Change you wish to see in the
                        World” has been our motto and a guiding principle since our inception. The LET US DREAM team has always been inspired by the quote of
                        the Saint of the Gutters, Mother Teresa. She said, “What we are doing is just a drop in the ocean. But if
                        that drop was not in the ocean, I think the ocean would be less because of that missing drop.”
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Inspired thus, LET US DREAM extends an invitation to every individual
                    to join this global community in order to raise and uplift our societies to progressive and better living standards so that we and the
                    generations to come may reap the benefits of the seeds we sow today. Each of us is called to act as a catalyst to positively impact another
                    person in our life’s time. Each of us has the power to foster positive change, which will have a spiralling impact to make the world a
                    better place.</p>

                    values after the vision of St. Kuriakose Elias Chavara, that is, the integral formation of a person and commitment to the society.
                    We as humans have so much to offer to the society. Success of each individual, strengthens and acts a s
                    foundation for the society to grow in. We believe humanity to be one global family, tied together, where our
                    excellence and holistic success as an individual or as a society is interdependent on each other. Growing in
                    the holistic view of life, we would like to DREAM together and grow together</p>

                            Thomas Pathickal, CMI, wanted to assist people to help children who are under confident, shy and struggle to
                            showcase their capabilities. The drive to share his insights with others like him and helping them realize their
                            full potential led him to forming the DREAM Program. The journey for developing and implementing the
                            programme has been through turbulent and testing times but the sheer will power and the conviction of Rev Fr
                            Lijo Thomas to help the others has helped the project stay afloat for many years now.
                        </p>
                        <p id="para3" class="text-justify">The Project gradually expanded but the turning point came in 2010, while he was
                            pursuing his Ph.D. in Educational Leadership, at the University of Louisiana, Monroe. His mentor at the time, Dr
                            Pauline Leonard, a professor at Louisiana Tech University, suggested that DREAM had the potential of being
                            developed into a working, scientific model and that was the moment the project steered towards the direction it is
                            flowing in today. It has become a 3-year curriculum-based community mentoring project, for schools and colleges.
                            Each year focuses on the development of skills and leadership, both at the personal and at the communal levels. The
                            program is further designed to encourage children, especially those with low self-confidence, to rise up to their
                            maximum potential, while also motivating others to do the same around them. Through a 3-stage developmental
                            model, <strong>DREAM</strong> helps individuals to work through <strong>D</strong>esire, <strong>R</strong>eadiness,
                            <strong>E</strong>mpowerment, and <strong>A</strong>ction, to attain <strong>M</strong>astery for success.
