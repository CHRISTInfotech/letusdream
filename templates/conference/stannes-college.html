            management. She credits her years in her alma mater, Mount Carmel College
            Bangalore, as an empowering and positive influence in her journey. With two
            decades of experience in program design and developing content and pedagogy,
            CMCA’s programs are enjoyable and powerful because she is first a passionate
            practitioner. Her designs leverage daily life experiences with their complexity,
            spontaneity and humour and rely on the innate goodness, initiative, energy, and
            curiosity of the young, into which she weaves research-backed learning
            principles. She enjoys music and reading poetry and the old classics where she
            can, for some hours, slow down to a pace which seems so much more moderate
            than our contemporary times!.
