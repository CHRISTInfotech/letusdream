        <p class="pl-4 pr-5">The LET US DREAM annual community conference at CHRIST (Deemed to be University),
            Bengaluru,
            India was conducted on 16th November 2019, under the eminent chairperson Mr. David S.R. The event had
            promoted
            better networking and collaboration among volunteers, potential volunteers, philanthropists, and community
            organizations; and brought up several community improvement programs on-board. The conference also
            introduced
            different community service possibilities and intervention models among younger and older generations to
            promote
            their volunteerism. Keynote addresses, three separate panel discussions–Education, Health and Social
            Service—and
            organizational table presentations held as part of the event were thought-provoking. The idea was widely
            acknowledged by pro-social individuals through their active participation.</p>
