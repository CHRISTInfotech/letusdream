                        Her educational background is in psychology, literature, journalism, and
                        management. She credits her years in her alma mater, Mount Carmel College
                        Bangalore, as an empowering and positive influence in her journey. With two
                        decades of experience in program design and developing content and pedagogy,
                        CMCA’s programs are enjoyable and powerful because she is first a passionate
                        practitioner. Her designs leverage daily life experiences with their complexity,
                        spontaneity and humour and rely on the innate goodness, initiative, energy, and
                        curiosity of the young, into which she weaves research-backed learning
                        principles. She enjoys music and reading poetry and the old classics where she
                        can, for some hours, slow down to a pace which seems so much more moderate
                        than our contemporary times!.
