                        of North Central Louisiana. An active member of her church, sorority, and the NAACP, she leads
                        the charge in
                        several parishes for completing and providing accurate information for census reports. She
                        understands the
                        importance of an informed voter and therefore during each cycle, she leads the efforts to
                        organize candidate

                    <div class="postcard__preview-txt">While you could start with the fact that valiantly Bobby Mounts
                        served his
                        country as a Marine, he is recognized today for how he has chosen to live his life as a civilian
                        and
                        businessman. Each year, PJ’s Coffee hosts a contest that allows a veteran the opportunity to win
                        a franchise.
                        Upon the urging of his wife, Mounts entered and became the second franchise winner. He chose to
                        open his
                        business in Ruston but as he opened his doors, he made a commitment to make a difference through
                        his work.
                        Beyond his ongoing support for veterans and veteran causes, Mounts dedicates one day each month
                        where a
                        portion of his proceeds goes to support non-profits and various needs throughout the community.
                        At his own
                        expense, he advertises and promotes these efforts, welcomes representatives from the benefitting
                        group, and
                        hosts special events to bring awareness to the cause. Yet Mounts does this quietly and without
                        fanfare because
                        he wants no credit; instead, he prefers the spotlight shine on those he is serving. He operates
                        with the
                        purest servant’s heart and with a desire to truly leave this world better than he found it
                        through his steady,
                        consistent gift. Whether mentoring college students or volunteering with 4-H, Mounts is a
                        warrior with a
                        sterling heart for service that represents “paying it forward” in the finest sense of the
                        expression.

                        became a tireless volunteer, checking on neighbors and senior citizens in her community where

                        consistently helped family after family with hot meals, water, and much needed supplies. But she

                        finished. Even after the tornado recovery began to subside, she chose to continue her service,
                        passing out
                        homemade soup once a week during the winter months to shut-ins as well as those individuals who
                        were sick
                        during their wellness checks. Furthermore, Tarpley teaches diabetes awareness as a licensed life
                        coach to help
                        individuals become better informed about how to live with the disease and also volunteers with
                        the TAPS
                        program which provide comfort, care and resources to those grieving the death of a military
                        loved one. A
                        resident of Ruston, Tarpley is known as a true caregiver who never meets a stranger and lives
                        her life daily
                        with the goal of making someone else’s life better.

                        the Lincoln
                        Parish Health Hut where she strives daily to bring the very best health care to those who may be
                        struggling
                        with how to pay for their care. She has established school-based health care programs throughout
                        the Lincoln
                        Parish School District, advocating for telemedicine protocols that will help keep students from
                        having to
                        leave school and their instructional time. White also gives of her time to the students of
                        Louisiana Tech
                        University, allowing them to shadow her and her staff. White readily engages with community
                        partners as well
                        as the university to improve the health of those who live throughout the parish. She has been
                        recognized as an

                        for all.
                        However, she is quick to allow others to have the spotlight, demurely declining opportunities so
                        that others
                        can have their moment to shine. Jackie White is a role model and inspiration to many, especially
                        young women
                        who want to have careers in medicine while also having a family and living a life of purpose
                        while practicing
                        selflessness through service.

                        effort that
                        brought together elected officials, law enforcement officers, religious leaders, and most

                        country and take

                        his commitment
                        to service is evident. Williams is said to possess resilience, integrity and the ability to
                        collaborate with
                        others to achieve a shared vision while remaining fully committed to giving back to this
