            Let Us Dream Community Conferences
        </div>
        <div class="lh-lg text-center cover">
            The Let Us Dream (LUD) Conferences are a powerful initiative dedicated to fostering community empowerment
            through compassion, collaboration, and service. What began as a local gathering in Monroe, Louisiana, has
            grown into a global movement, comprising both annual community conferences and triennial international
            conferences.

            <div class="lh-lg text-center">
                The first LET US DREAM conference was launched in 2017 to inspire community service.
                From then on, all conferences organized have provided a platform to learn, share, and celebrate acts of
                volunteerism. The first Triennial International Conference was conducted virtually in 2020 during the
                pandemic. It highlighted resilience and strength, showcasing community initiatives from around the
                world. The conference targets both younger and older generations, introducing them to various community
                service opportunities and models. Through discussions and presentations, attendees gain insights and
                recommendations for positive community development. Currently, conferences are organized around the
                world. This includes multiple locations in India and USA, and countries like Germany, Nepal, South
                Africa, and more.
