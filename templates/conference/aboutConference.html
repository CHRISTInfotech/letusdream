            The Let Us Dream (LUD) Conferences are a powerful initiative dedicated to fostering community empowerment
            through compassion, collaboration, and service. What began as a local gathering in Monroe, Louisiana, has
            grown into a global movement, comprising both annual community conferences and triennial international
            conferences.

                        History of LUD Conferences
                    </div>

                    The first LET US DREAM conference was launched in 2017 to inspire community service.
                    From then on, all conferences organized have provided a platform to learn, share, and celebrate acts
                    of volunteerism. The first Triennial International Conference was conducted virtually in 2020 during
                    the pandemic. It highlighted resilience and strength, showcasing community initiatives from around
                    the world. The conference targets both younger and older generations, introducing them to various
                    community service opportunities and models. Through discussions and presentations, attendees gain
                    insights and recommendations for positive community development. Currently, conferences are
                    organized around the world. This includes multiple locations in India and USA, and countries like
                    Germany, Nepal, South Africa, and more.
