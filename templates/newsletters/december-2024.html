              <p> Today, the Let Us Dream Conference 2024 occurred at the Binghamton University Downtown Center,
                centered on
                "Empowering Community Betterment." This inspiring event brought together students, local organizations,
                and community leaders to share stories of leadership and foster meaningful collaboration.</p>

              <p>Fr. Lijo Thomas, founder and director of Let Us Dream, shared his vision for the conference: “The idea
                came about to bring local community service initiatives together to share their stories with the next
                generation and connect universities with community organizations. It’s a space for people with bigger
                hearts for their community—not for themselves—who are focused on making others’ lives easier and
                happier.”</p>

              <p> The conference served as a hub for community engagement, spotlighting organizations like the
                Children’s
                Home, the Center of Treatment Innovation, and the Lee Barta Community Center. A standout feature was
                Nathan’s Butterflies, an organization founded by Ben Cucci following the loss of his brother at a young
                age.</p>

              <p> Ben, alongside President Frances Bidwell, has worked tirelessly to raise awareness about youth grief.
                Bidwell reflected, “He knew he felt better with a kind act and wanted his grieving family to feel better
                too. Eight years into this, Ben, now a freshman at Vestal High School, has continued to grow civic
                engagement among diverse groups of children and families.”</p>

              <p>Ben’s dedication was honored with the prestigious "Changemaker" award, recognizing exceptional
                contributions to non-profit service. As the youngest of ten award recipients this year, his story of
                resilience and leadership resonated deeply with attendees.</p>

              <p>The event highlighted the transformative power of compassion and collaboration, inspiring participants
                to
                pursue meaningful contributions to their communities.

              <p>The Let us Dream Conference was held today at the Binghamton University Downtown Center, with the
                overarching theme being empowering community betterment.</p>

              <p>Father Lijo Thomas, the founder and director of Let us Dream, hoped the students would find
                opportunities
                and be inspired by the stories of community leadership.</p>

              <p>"The idea came out to bring in local community, small, community service initiatives together and share
                their stories for the next generations and connect universities to different community organizations.
                it's
                a space for people with bigger hearts for their community, not for self. Their hearts are filled with
                the
                community and what they can make others' lives easier and happier," Thomas said.</p>

              <p> It serves as a hub for community engagement and involvement, including Children's Home, the Center of
                Treatment Innovation, and the Lee Barta Community Center.</p>

              <p>One such organization is Nathan's Butterflies, an organization founded by Ben Cucci, who lost his
                brother
                at a young age.</p>

              <p>Alongside President Frances Bidwell, they now use the organization to raise awareness about youth
                grief.</p>
              <p>"He knew he felt better with a kind act, and he wanted his grieving family to feel better, too. Eight
                years into this, he's now a freshman at Vestal High School, and he's continued to grow civic engagement
                amongst many different groups of children and families," Bidwell said.</p>

              <p> A mission rewarded with a "Changemaker" award to Ben, an award to recognize outstanding work in
                non-profit
                service, with Ben the youngest recipient of the ten today.</p>
