                    The primary aim of this club is to engage in casual and reflective conversations. While the
                    discourse is informal, the topics are intriguing, provocative, and frequently laced with humor. A
                    wide range of themes, spanning the serious to the whimsical, are discussed at monthly online
                    meetings. Some topics thus far include Inclusion And Equity, Empathy and Compassion, Personal
                    Decision-Making Styles, Inspirational Persons; Food, Clothes, Personal Uniqueness, and Cancel
                    Culture.

                    While each LUD Club has a distinct focus, the overall structure of the Conversation Club includes
                    virtual meetings every Wednesday, the third week of the month. This includes 12-15 active members
                    who wish to engage in discourse grounded in shared interests. Generally, a group member assumes a
                    manager role to ensure that meeting dates, times, and topics are collaboratively identified and
                    scheduled. Clubs are self-organised, self-managed, and self-generated, and leadership is shared
                    among group members. Mutual accountability is inherent in club discussions inasmuch as there is a
                    periodic sharing of goals and progress. A one-hour timebox for each meeting is maintained.
