Later a team of volunteers, Mrs. Angie Opry, Mrs. Janet Breard, Fr. Job Scaria, and additional community volunteers joined the team. Ms. Kaici Gordon was the first youth volunteer to join the team. She, along with many other teens, brought enthusiasm and leadership that participants could relate to.",

Mr. Lamar Trichelle played a significant role in getting the band started. His commitment to the band, along with Mr. Gary Guiniguindo and Kody Chase, made the dream possible.
